/**
 * JPF regression test for breaking transitions when exceeding
 * vm.max_transition_length. While the program would not terminate outside
 * JPF, it will terminate when run under JPF because of state matching
 * 
 * the listener is purely informative - if the test fails it doesn't terminate.
 * It should report two registrations within the loop, the second one matching
 * the state that was stored after the first one. However, the number of 
 * transition breaks might change with more sophisticated loop detection
