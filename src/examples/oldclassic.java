/**
 * This example shows a deadlock that occurs as a result of a missed signal,
 * i.e. a wait() that happens after the corresponding notify().
 * 
 * The defect is caused by a violated monitor encapsulation, i.e. directly
 * accessing monitor internal data ('Event.count') from concurrent clients
 * ('FirstTask', 'SecondTask'), without synchronization with the
 * corresponding monitor operations ('wait_for-Event()' and 'signalEvent()').
 * 
 * The resulting race is typical for unsafe optimizations that try to 
 * avoid expensive blocking calls by means of local caches
 * 
 * This example was inspired by a defect found in the "Remote Agent" 
 * spacecraft controller that flew on board of "Deep Space 1", as described
 * in: 
 * 
 *   Model Checking Programs
