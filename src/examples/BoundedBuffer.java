/**
 * concurrency example with deadlock
 * adapted from "Concurrency: State Models & Java Programs", Jeff Magee & Jeff Kramer
 * 
 * Note there need to be at least 2x buffer_size instances of either producers or
 * consumers in order to produce the deadlock, which basically depends on 
 * a notification choice between a consumer and a producer in a context where
 * only threads of the notifier type are still runnable
 * 
 * This is a good benchmark for state management/matching in a small heap context.
 * Higher numbers of buffer size and producers/consumers result in a nice
 * state explosion
