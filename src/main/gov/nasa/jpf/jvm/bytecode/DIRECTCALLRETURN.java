 * this is used to return from a DirectCallStackFrame
 *
 * Note that it is NOT a ReturnInstruction, in case listeners monitor these
 * and expect corresponding InvokeInstructions. Although this would seem intuitive, it
 * would be pointless to derive because the ReturnInstruction.enter() does
 * a lot of things we would have to cut off, i.e. it would require more effort
 * to undo this (no sync, no return value, no pc advance on the returned-to
 * stackframe etc.)
 *
 * However, having a dedicated direct call return instruction makes sense so
 * that the ReturnInstruction of the called method does not have to handle
 * direct calls specifically
