   * do a little bytecode pattern analysis on the fly, to find out if a
   * GETFIELD or GETSTATIC is just part of a "..synchronized (obj) {..} .."
   * pattern, which usually translates into the following pattern:
   *   ...
   *   getfield / getstatic
   *   dup
   *   [astore]
   *   monitorenter
   *   ...
   *
   * If it does, there is no need to break the transition since the object
   * reference is not used for anything that can cause violations between
   * the get and the monitorenter.
   *
   * <2do> We might want to extend this in the future to also cover sync on
   * local vars, like "Object o = myField; synchronized(o){..}..", but then
   * the check becomes more expensive since we get interspersed aload/astore
   * insns, and some of the locals could be used outside the sync block. Not
   * sure if it buys much on the bottom line
   *   
   * <2do> this relies on javac code patterns. The dup/astore could
   * lead to subsequent use of the object reference w/o corresponding get/putfield
   * insns (if it's not a volatile), but this access would be either a call
   * or a get/putfield on a share object, i.e. would be checked separately
