/**
 * this is an artificial bytecode that we use to deal with the particularities of 
 * <clinit> calls, which are never in the loaded bytecode but always directly called by
 * the VM. The most obvious difference is that <clinit> execution does not trigger
 * class initialization.
 * A more subtle difference is that we save a wait() - if a class
 * is concurrently initialized, both enter INVOKECLINIT (i.e. compete and sync for/on
 * the class object lock), but once the second thread gets resumed and detects that the
 * class is now initialized (by the first thread), it skips the method execution and
 * returns right away (after deregistering as a lock contender). That's kind of hackish,
 * but we have no method to do the wait in, unless we significantly complicate the
 * direct call stubs, which would obfuscate observability (debugging dynamically
 * generated code isn't very appealing).
