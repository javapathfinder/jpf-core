/**
 * a policy interface related to locking, blocking and thread lifetime
 * events.
 * 
 * As opposed to field access and SharednessPolicy, most of these events
 * are of mandatory nature, but we want to support varying order and degrees of
 * precision with respect to scheduling candidates
 * 
 * NOTE - this interface is part of dividing the old SchedulerFactory (which was
 * mostly concerned about scheduling order) into separate policy interfaces
 * that allow control over
 *  - CG type
 *  - choice values
 *  - choice order
 * based on operation (instruction type, MJI methods), which might require
 * additional, policy related state (e.g. threads competing for the same object).
 * 
 * Since the policies are interfaces kept at the same level, and are only
 * accessed through ThreadInfo facades, they can be implemented by a single
 * class/object
