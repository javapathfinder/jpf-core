/**

 *
 * This is a "controlflow exception", but I finally made my peace with it since
 * UncaughtExceptions can be thrown from various places, including the VM (<clinit>, finalizer)
 * and we can't rely on that all these locations can check for pc == null. Even if they would,
 * at this point there is nothing to do anymore, get to the NoUncaughtProperty reporting
 * as quickly as possible, since chances are we would be even obfuscating the problem
