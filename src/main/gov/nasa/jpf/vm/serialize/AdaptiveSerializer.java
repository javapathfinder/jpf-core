 * a CG type adaptive, canonicalizing & filtering serializer that is an
 * under-approximation mostly aimed at finding data races and deadlocks in programs
 * with a large number of scheduling points (= thread choices)
 *
 * This came to bear by accidentally discovering that JPF often seems to finds
 * concurrency defects by just serializing the thread states, their topmost stack
 * frames and the objects directly referenced from there.
 * For non-scheduling points, we just fall back to serializing statics, all thread
 * stacks and all the data reachable from there
