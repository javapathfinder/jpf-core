/**
 * Marks static final field of primitive or known immutable type to be
 * filtered.  In theory, these could be critical to state, but that would
 * be highly irregular.
 * 
 * NOTE - final does not really mean constant, so we only ignore fields
 * here that are initialized from lexical constants, i.e. a constpool entry.
 * Others might involve data choice generators
 * 
 * <br><br>
 * Ignoring constants probably isn't beneficial with the FilteringSerializer
 * but could be a big win with AbstractingSerializer, which garbage-collects
 * no-longer-reachable objects--that is, garbage collection in its
 * representation, not in VM.
