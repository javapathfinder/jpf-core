 *
 * This unchecked exception is thrown by the host VM. It captures all errors
 * and exceptions that can occur at the load of a JPF class, which includes 
 * defining, and resolving it. Here are some of the scenarios that this 
 * exception is thrown and captures the corresponding exception:
 *
 *    * if the representation does not represent a class with the requested 
 *      name, loading throws an instance of NoClassDefFoundError
 *
 *    * if any of the superclasses of a class, is the class itself, or if 
 *      any of the superinterfaces of an interface, is the interface itself, 
 *      loading throws an instance of ClassCircularityError
 *
 *    * if the representation is not a ClassFile structure, loading throws an
 *      instance of ClassFormatError
 * 
 * If this exception is thrown during the initialization of VM, and the failed
 * class is a system class, or creating of the main thread in not successful, we 
 * immediately bail out by throwing JPFException.
 * 
 * While JPF is running, this error is handled by throwing an exception at the 
 * SUT level. This exception is handled if it is thrown by 
 * 
 *    1. a native peer method,  
 *    2. Intruction.execute(),
 *    3. ThreadInfo.creatAndThrowException()
 *    4. VM.initialize() // here it is handled only if it a non-system class
 * 
 * If this exception is thrown by a Listener, the host VM throws JPFListenerException.
