/**
 * this is a straight execution pseudo-search - it doesn't search at
 * all (i.e. it doesn't backtrack), but just behaves like a 'normal' VM,
 * going forward() until there is no next state
 *
 * <2do> of course it doesn't quite behave like a normal VM, since it
 * doesn't honor thread priorities yet (needs a special scheduler)
 *
 * <2do> it's not really clear to me how this differs from a 'PathSearch'
 * other than using a different scheduler. Looks like there should be just one
 *
 * <2do> this needs to be updated & tested
