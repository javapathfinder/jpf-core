/**
 * The {@code Search} abstract class is at the heart of all search classes. Even when it is not extended by child classes, it will
 * be embedded in the logic as an input for some of the methods. 
 * 
 * <p>The main purpose of the {@code Search} class is to track general search information such as depth, configured properties, 
 * errors, etc. as well as to define how the search algorithm functions. In its simplest form, a search algorithm can be defined 
 * using the abstract method {@code search} with a series of {@code forward} and {@code backtrack}. More complex search 
 * algorithms can also make use of the state storing functionality of the {@code Search} class, as well as ignoring states and
 * removing states from the search tree.
 * 
 * <p>Another very important aspect of the {@code Search} class is not only to implement search algorithms, but also to define
 * the information that describes the current search loop. This is crucial in order to enable the {@code SearchListener} and 
 * {@code SearchListenerAdapter} classes responsible for extracting crucial data from the search loop during its verification
 * efforts.
