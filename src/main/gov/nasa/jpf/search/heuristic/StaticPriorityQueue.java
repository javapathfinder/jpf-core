/**
 * container for statically prioritized states, based on bounded
 * RB trees
 * 
 * TreeSet is a better choice than PriorityQueue since the size
 * constraint means we have to remove elements from both ends, which
 * is inefficient with heaps. A simple (binary) sorted array using
 * block copy can be more efficient, but that very much depends on
 * queue size and processor, so it's not really worth the trouble
 * 
 * <2do> this needs to be re-evaluated in light of the stupid fact
 * that pollFirst()/pollLast() are only in Java 1.6 and we can't switch
 * yet (no Java 1.6 for PPC), which forces us to do some shuffling to
 * make remove(last()) work as expected
