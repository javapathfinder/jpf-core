 * a generator for pair-wise permutations, which only considers permutations
 * for each pair of elements, regardless of position. This reduces the
 * number of generated permutations from N! to sum(i=1..N){N-i} + 1.
 * This can be used to test order dependencies between two concurrent
 * entities (threads, state machines etc), based on the same assumptions
 * that are used in pair-wise testing
