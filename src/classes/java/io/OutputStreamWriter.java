/**
 * natively convert char output into byte output
 *
 * <2do> - this needs to be reworked. It trades locks for saving heap objects,
 * and that is a choice between a rock and a hard place. We shouldn't call
 * write() from within the native encode() (which we would have to since this
 * could be any OutputStream). We shouldn't create a very short
 * living JPF byte[] object per write() call, since that kills the heap. We
 * shouldn't use an explicit lock since that blows up the state space. That
 * leaves us with atomic sections, but it's not really safe since clients
 * might use their own OutputStream classes with synchronized write() methods.
 * At least this would not go unnoticed
