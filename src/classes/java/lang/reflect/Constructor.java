 * pretty stupid - this is almost identical to Method, but we can't derive,
 * and the delegation happens at the peer level anyways.
 * 
 * NOTE: 'regIdx' and 'name' need to be like Method, or the peer delegation
 * fails (this is the hack'ish part)
 * 
 * NOTE: we ditch the 'final' modifier so that we can provide our
 * own serialization ctor objects - that's probably going away
 * once we replace ObjectStreamClass
