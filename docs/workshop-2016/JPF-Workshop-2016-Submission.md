## Submission

[EasyChair submission page](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=jpf2016)

We solicit regular paper submissions on existing research and
applications related to JPF or its extensions. If the underlying
research idea has been published in another venue the paper needs to
clarify the novel aspects that are being presented in the paper. We
also solicit extended abstracts submissions on
recent work or work in progress. We welcome comparative analysis
papers that evaluate algorithms in JPF or its extensions with other
relevant tools. The goal of the workshop is to encourage the flow of
ideas relevant to JPF and Java/Android program analysis in
general. The papers should be in the [ACM SIG
Proceedings format](http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template).

**Categories of papers:**

- Regular papers (at most ***5 pages long***; Accepted ***regular papers*** will be published in the Software Engineering Notes (SEN) and the ACM digital library.)
- Extended abstract (at most ***2 pages long***)

**Topics of interest:**

- JPF extensions or tools
- JPF case studies
- Java program analysis or verification
- Android program analysis or verification
- General software verification techniques, tools, or analysis
