The JPF core and most of its extensions are pure Java applications, so there are not many platform requirements other than sufficient memory and a reasonably fast machine.

You can obtain JPF sources from the Git repositories. You need at least the core of JPF, [jpf-core](https://github.com/javapathfinder/jpf-core), which can be built from the command line using Gradle.

The JPF core project already comes with its configuration file, but you have to create a per-site [site.properties](Creating-site-properties-file) file.

Here are the details:

  - [System requirements.](System-requirements)
  - [Downloading binary snapshots.](Downloading-binary-snapshots)
  - [Downloading sources from the GitHub repositories.](Downloading-sources)
  - [Creating a site properties file.](Creating-site-properties-file)
  - [Building, testing, and running.](Build,-Test,-Run)
