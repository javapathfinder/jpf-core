This year, the workshop is co-located with [FSE/ESEC](https://conf.researchr.org/home/fse-2018) in Lake Buena Vista, Florida, United States on November 5, 2018. The main workshop webpage is [here](https://2018.fseconference.org/track/jpf-2018-papers).

The goal of the workshop is to highlight research and tools for Java/Android program verification and analysis. Although there is a particular emphasis on the JPF tool, and on projects that use JPF to support basic research, tool development, or verification case studies, the workshop also welcomes contributions related to general program analysis of Java/Android programs. The hope is to use the workshop to grow the community of researchers investigating Java, Android, and JPF in an effort to foster collaboration and define future needs for program analysis of Java/Android.

## Call for Papers

We solicit regular paper submissions on existing research and applications related to JPF or its extensions. If the underlying research idea has been published in another venue, the paper needs to clarify the novel aspects that are being presented in the paper. We also solicit extended abstracts and position paper submissions on recent work or work in progress. We welcome comparative analysis papers that evaluate algorithms in JPF or its extensions with other relevant tools. The goal of the workshop is to encourage the flow of ideas relevant to JPF and Java/Android program analysis in general.

Topics of interest include the following:

  * JPF extensions or tools
  * JPF case studies
  * Position papers on JPF, such as future directions
  * Java program analysis or verification
  * Android program analysis or verification
  * General software verification techniques or tools

We solicit two types of submissions to be uploaded on [EasyChair/JPF2018](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=jpf2018):

1. Regular papers: At most 5-page long papers in the [ACM SIG Proceedings](http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template) format will be reviewed by the organizing committee. Accepted regular papers will be presented at the workshop and published in the [ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes](https://www.sigsoft.org/SEN) and the ACM Digital Library, as in previous years.

2. Extended abstracts: At most 2-page long abstracts will be selected by the organizing committee. Accepted abstracts will be presented at the workshop but NOT published.
