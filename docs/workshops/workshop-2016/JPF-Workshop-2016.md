This year the workshop is a satelite workshop with
[FSE](http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/fse2016/) in Seattle, WA, on November
18 2016. The goal of the workshop in 2016 is to highlight research and
tools for Java/Android program verification and analysis. Although
there is a particular emphasis on the Java Pathfinder (JPF) tool, and
on projects that use JPF to support basic research, tool development,
or verification case studies, the workshop also welcomes contributions
related to general program analysis of Java/Android programs. The hope
is to use the workshop to grow the community of researchers
investigating Java, Android, and JPF in an effort to foster
collaboration and define future needs for Java program analysis.
