*Patrice Godefroid is a Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research.  He
received a B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering (Computer Science
elective) and a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from the University
of Liege, Belgium, in 1989 and 1994 respectively.  From 1994 to 2006,
he worked at Bell Laboratories (part of Lucent Technologies), where he
was promoted to "distinguished member of technical staff" in 2001. His
research interests include program (mostly software) specification,
analysis, testing and verification.*

Title: From Dynamic Software Model Checking to Better Beer
 
Abstract: Dynamic software model checking consists of adapting model
checking into a form of systematic testing that is applicable to
industrial-size software. When I started research on this topic more
than 20 years ago, I never imagined that it could one day help improve
beer making. This talk will present this unexpected
journey. Specifically (spoiler alert!), some key milestones are the
birth of [dynamic software model
checking](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/pg/public_psfiles/popl97.ps),
[DART](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/pg/public_psfiles/pldi2005.pdf),
[SAGE](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/pg/public_psfiles/ndss2008.pdf),
how we [deployed SAGE on a large
scale](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/pg/public_psfiles/icse2013.pdf)
inside Microsoft to [find many security
vulnerabilities](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/pg/public_psfiles/cacm2012.pdf),
and how we [recently
launched](https://blogs.microsoft.com/next/2016/09/26/microsoft-previews-project-springfield-cloud-based-bug-detector/)
the first commercial cloud fuzzing service, named [Project
Springfield](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/springfield/).
 
In short, if you like model checking or beer, donâ€™t miss this talk!
