## CALL FOR PAPERS

**Java Pathfinder Workshop 2016**  
Satellite Workshop with FSE 2016  
Seattle, WA, USA  
November 2016

### IMPORTANT DATES

- **Submission**: August 5, 2016 ~~July 1, 2016~~
- **Notification**: September 7, 2016
- **Camera Version**: September 29, 2016
- **Workshop**: November 18, 2016

### OVERVIEW

The goal of the workshop is to highlight research and tools for
Java/Android program verification and analysis. Although there is a
particular emphasis on the Java Pathfinder (JPF) tool, and on projects
that use JPF to support basic research, tool development, or
verification case studies, the workshop also welcomes contributions
related to general program analysis of Java/Android programs. The hope
is to use the workshop to grow the community of researchers
investigating Java, Android, and JPF in an effort to foster
collaboration and define future needs for Java program analysis.

### SUBMISSION

We solicit regular paper submissions on existing research and
applications related to JPF or its extensions. If the underlying
research idea has been published in another venue the paper needs to
clarify the novel aspects that are being presented in the paper. We
also solicit extended abstracts submissions on
recent work or work in progress. We welcome comparative analysis
papers that evaluate algorithms in JPF or its extensions with other
relevant tools. The goal of the workshop is to encourage the flow of
ideas relevant to JPF and Java/Android program analysis in
general. The papers should be in the [ACM SIG
Proceedings format](http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template).

**Categories of papers:**

- Regular papers (at most ***5 pages long***; Accepted ***regular papers*** will be published in the Software Engineering Notes (SEN) and the ACM digital library.)
- Extended abstract (at most ***2 pages long***)

**Topics of interest:**

- JPF extensions or tools
- JPF case studies
- Java program analysis or verification
- Android program analysis or verification
- General software verification techniques, tools, or analysis

### PARTICIPATION

We invite practitioners, academics, and students who are interested in
Java development, automated program analysis, and other aspects of 
software engineering research to attend the workshop. Submitting a
paper is not required to participate, enjoy, and learn about JPF.
