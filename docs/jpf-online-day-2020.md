Since 2008, ten times the Java PathFinder (JPF) workshop has been organized. Given the current pandemic, in 2020 we will organize a JPF day instead. On Saturday, November 7, two Zoom sessions will be held (11:00-13:00 UTC and 15:00-17:00 UTC).

For the JPF day, we solicit presentations on research and applications related to JPF and its extensions, including work in progress. If the underlying research idea has been presented in another venue, the one-page abstract needs to clarify the novel aspects that are being presented. We also welcome comparative analysis presentations that evaluate algorithms in JPF or its extensions with other relevant tools. The goal of the JPF day is to encourage the flow of ideas relevant to JPF and Java (byte)code analysis in general.

Topics of interest include the following:

  * JPF extensions or tools
  * JPF case studies
  * Position papers on JPF, such as future directions
  * Java (byte)code analysis or verification
  * General software verification and symbolic execution techniques or tools

## Submissions

Submit a one-page abstract to parizek@d3s.mff.cuni.cz and franck@eecs.yorku.ca by Friday, October 23.

## Presentations

Each accepted presenter will get assigned a 15 minutes slot, 5-10 minutes presentation (leaving the exact length up to the presenter), and the remainder for questions and discussion. Preference for the early or late session will be taken into account, but cannot be guaranteed. The presentation can be either recorded in advance or live.

## Participation

For those interested in participating, please send an email to parizek@d3s.mff.cuni.cz and franck@eecs.yorku.ca with the subject JPF 2020. The receipt of your email will be acknowledged and the Zoom details will be emailed to you one day in advance of the meeting.
