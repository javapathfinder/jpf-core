# JPF 2021 - December 4 - *online*

## Call for presentations

Since 2008, ten times the *Java PathFinder (JPF) workshop* has been
organized. Given the current pandemic, as in 2020 also this year we
will organize a **JPF day** instead. On **Saturday, December 4**, two Zoom
sessions will be held (11:00-13:00 UTC and 17:00-19:00 UTC).

For the JPF day, we solicit presentations on research and applications
related to JPF and its extensions, including work in progress. If the
underlying research idea has been presented in another venue, the
one-page abstract needs to clarify the novel aspects that are being
presented. We also welcome comparative analysis presentations that
evaluate algorithms in JPF or its extensions with other relevant tools.
The goal of the JPF day is to encourage the flow of ideas relevant to
JPF and Java (byte)code analysis in general.

Topics of interest include the following:
* JPF extensions or tools
* JPF case studies
* Position papers on JPF, such as future directions
* Java (byte)code analysis or verification
* General software verification and symbolic execution techniques or
tools

## Submissions

Submit a one-page abstract to [javapathfinder21@gmail.com](mailto:javapathfinder21@gmail.com) by 
**Friday, November 13**.

## Presentations

Each accepted presenter will get assigned a 15 minutes slot, 5-10
minutes presentation (leaving the exact length up to the presenter), and
the remainder for questions and discussion. Preference for the early or
late session will be taken into account, but cannot be guaranteed.The
presentation can be either recorded in advance or live.
