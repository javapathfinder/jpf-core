# Summer Project Summit 2010
This years summer summit is going to take place on Friday, August 13th at the â€‹Googleplex in Mountain View, CA. (the date explains why we couldn't meet at NASA - "..it comes after 12, Hon..").

The main purpose of the summit is to let students and mentors of our summer projects present the great work they have done during the past two months. Time permitting, we will also talk about the general state of affairs, and discuss future directions & collaborations. It's all informal, ad hoc and lively. Open source, in other words.

The meeting is open, free (as in beer) and you don't need to register upfront. All JPF enthusiasts are welcome. However, we have to be escorted and therefore the plan is to meet at 8:45am in the main lobby of Bldg. 43. If you come late, you have to take your chances with the receptionist in the lobby, who will contact us. Try to avoid.

Come in and have fun.
