# JPF Google Summer of Code 2018 (Archive)

This is an archived page from GSoC 2018. For current opportunities, see the [main GSoC page](index).

Java Pathfinder (JPF) participated in [Google Summer of Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/) 2018. You can learn more about JPF at the [JPF wiki](https://github.com/javapathfinder/jpf-core/wiki).

## Required Skills ##

JPF is written in Java, and it analyzes Java bytecode, so the minimum skill required is to be familiar with Java and have some development experience with Java (class projects or industry experience). At a minimum you should know there is more to it than just the language - it's the language, the libraries and the virtual machine/bytecodes. Not all projects require a deep understanding of Java or JPF though, please look at the project descriptions to determine which skills are most important.

JPF is a software verification tool. It is a customizable virtual machine that enables the development of various verification algorithms. It will be to your advantage if you are familiar with formal methods, software testing, or model checking. However, JPF is where research meets development, so for many projects it is not a show stopper. We are looking for students who are highly motivated, bright, willing to learn, and love to code.

JPF is a fairly complex system. The first step to start is to get JPF [running](Running-JPF) and [configured](Configuring-JPF). This in itself can be a steep learning curve. It also helps if you already know what [listeners](Listeners), [bytecode factories](Bytecode-Factories) and [native peers](Model-Java-Interface) are, but no worries - the mentors will help you there. One thing you have to look at, but what is now surprisingly simple is how to [set up JPF projects](create_project).

## Applying for GSoC ##

You will need to submit a proposal to Google during the student application phase (03/12 - 03/27). Check out the [GSoC FAQ](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq) page for more information.
