### Project Description

<a name="support-java-11"></a>
#### Support Java 11 (bootstrap methods and other issues) for jpf-core

**Description:**
jpf-core is essentially a JVM that currently fully supports only Java 8. The goal of this project is to make it up-to-date with new features of Java 11. The JPF source itself has already been made compatible with Java 11. Now, JPF should support new features of Java 11 bytecode. Thanks to work in 2019 and especially 2020, a lot of this works now, but there is still work left to do.

The key feature of Java 11 that is currently not fully supported are bootstrap methods that are generated at load time. They are used for things as common as string concatenation ("Hello, " + name). As of now, many cases are supported, but there are still many programs (and unit tests) that fail with Java 11. It is therefore very important for us that we support the general case of this feature. The current state can be seen by running the unit tests of branch `java-10-gradle` with Java 11 and by looking at [Issue #274](https://github.com/javapathfinder/jpf-core/issues/274).

This is a high-priority project, as support for Java 8 is limited to the near future.
*Note:* You can apply to both projects (Java 11 or 12 support); in that case, please indicate that you would like to work on either one, and what your preference would be.

**Difficulty:** Hard  
**Scope:** 350 hours  
**Required skills:** Knowledge of Java bytecode  
**Preferred skills:** Knowledge of bootstrap methods in Java bytecode  
**Possible Mentors:** Cyrille

<a name="support-java-12"></a>
#### Support for Java 12 (private API dependencies) for jpf-core

Related to the project above, there are also some internal APIs from Java 11 that no longer exist in Java 12 and later.
This requires redesigning and reimplementing part of the code, in order to take a different approach that no longer depends on functionality that was removed in Java 12. The code in question is easily found by trying to compile branch `java-10-gradle` with Java 12.
*Note:* You can apply to both projects (Java 11 or 12 support); in that case, please indicate that you would like to work on either one, and what your preference would be.

**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Scope:** 175 hours  
**Required skills:** Knowledge of Java internals  
**Possible Mentors:** Cyrille

<a name="mbt-modbat"></a>
#### Test Case Generation/Model-based Testing with Modbat for JPF

**Description:**
JPF requires test cases as a starting point to explore a system. It is therefore suitable to use
test case generation to create test cases automatically. [Modbat](https://github.com/cyrille-artho/modbat/) is an open-source tool for test case generation. For testing concurrent software,
an obvious choice would be to combine Modbat (to generate tests) with JPF (to execute tests and
find concurrency problems). This has been done once as a [proof of concept](https://people.kth.se/~artho/papers/ase-2013-preprint.pdf) but is not supported in the current version of Modbat.
The main reason for this is that Modbat's reporting has to read and parse bytecode, which requires
access to some native code that JPF does not support.
The goal is to find all problems where Modbat requires native access, and to use jpf-nhandler
to resolve as many of these cases as possible. Remaining cases can be handled with custom model/peer classes, perhaps not with the full feature set, but at least to avoid JPF aborting due to an unsupported feature.

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Scope:** 350 hours  
**Required skills:** Knowledge of Java Pathfinder  
**Preferred skills:** Knowledge of test generation  
**Possible Mentors:** Cyrille


<a name="support-gradle-for-spf"></a>
#### Support for gradle for SPF

**Description:**
The goal of this project is to (1) implement gradle support for Symbolic Pathfinder, (2) to update the extension template, including gradle support and updated documentation.

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Scope:** 175 hours  
**Required skills:** Knowledge of Java Pathfinder and Gradle build automation  
**Preferred skills:** Knowledge of Symbolic Pathfinder  
**Possible Mentors:** Yannic, Corina

<a name="support-java-11-for-spf"></a>
#### Support for Java v11 for SPF

**Description:**
The goal of this project is to upgrade SPF to work with Java 11.

**Difficulty:** Hard  
**Scope:** 350 hours  
**Required skills:** Knowledge of Symbolic Pathfinder   
**Preferred skills:** Knowledge of Java v11  
**Possible Mentors:** Yannic, Corina

<a name="improving-string-analysis-in-spf"></a>
#### Robustify String solving for SPF

**Description:**
The goal of this project is to test SPF integration with Z3 string constraint solving; adding support cvc5 is a plus.


**Difficulty:** Hard  
**Scope:** 350 hours  
**Required skills:** Knowledge of Symbolic Pathfinder   
**Preferred skills:** Knowledge of String constraint solving.  
**Possible Mentors:** Yannic, Corina, Elena, Soha

<!--
<a name="random-search-in-spf"></a>
#### Support Random Search Strategy in SPF   

**Description:**
SPF currently uses a depth-first search strategy, in this project we will add random search strategy to SPF. This will allow SPF to have faster coverage given a limited time budget.  

**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Required skills:** Knowledge of Symbolic Pathfinder.  
**Preferred skills:** Knowledge of random search strategy.  

 
<a name="minimize-testcases-path-merging"></a>
#### Minimizing Test-Cases for Branch Coverage of Path-Merged Regions

**Description:**
When generating test cases for path-merging more branch obligations could be covered with a single test case. In this project, we will focus on ways to minimize the number of test cases generated from path-merging for branch coverage criteria. 

**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Required skills:** Knowledge of Symbolic PathFinder.  
**Preferred skills:** Knowledge of Java Ranger.
