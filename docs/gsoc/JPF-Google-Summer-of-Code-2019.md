## Required Skills ##

JPF is written in Java, and it analyzes Java bytecode, so the minimum skill required is to be familiar with Java and have some development experience with Java (class projects or industry experience). At a minimum you should know there is more to it than just the language - it's the language, the libraries and the virtual machine/bytecodes. Not all projects require a deep understanding of Java or JPF though, please look at the project descriptions to determine which skills are most important.

JPF is a software verification tool. It is a customizable virtual machine that enables the development of various verification algorithms. It will be to your advantage if you are familiar with formal methods, software testing, or model checking. However, JPF is where research meets development, so for many projects it is not a show stopper. We are looking for students who are highly motivated, bright, willing to learn, and love to code.

JPF is a fairly complex system. The first step to start is to get JPF [running](Running-JPF) and [configured](Configuring-JPF). This in itself can be a steep learning curve. It also helps if you already know what [listeners](Listeners), [bytecode factories](Bytecode-Factories) and [native peers](Model-Java-Interface) are, but no worries - the mentors will help you there. One thing you have to look at, but what is now surprisingly simple is how to [set up JPF projects](create_project).

## Applying for GSoC ##

You will need to submit a proposal to Google during the student application phase. Check out the [GSoC FAQ](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq) page for more information. 

### Proposal outline

A good proposal should contain the following:

1. Title, summary (about 100 words).

2. Goals. Have multiple, prioritized goals, so you have alternatives if something does not go as expected.

3. Implementation plan. An initial plan of how to reach the first goal(s).

4. Tentative timeline. Be detailed for the first three weeks, and outline the remainder. Leave open some extra time for unexpected problems.

5. Self-introduction. This should include past contributions to open-source software (JPF or other). If you can submit a patch to JPF to fixes a small problem, this is the best proof that you can successfully use and modify JPF!
